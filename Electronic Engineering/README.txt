This folder contains the code necessary for characterizing magnetic fields 
with the system designed and constructed in the bachelor thesis. That is done 
through "Solenoid_characterization.ipynb". 

First it is necessary to upload to the arduino one of the codes in the Arduino folder. 
"mlx90395" is the original code provided by the company. 

"mlx_innermedia" is the file used in the project,it performs the mean of 100 measurements 
in order to not collapse the USB.

Dipole and magnetic_profile contain codes for plotting acquired data. And the corresponding data files.
