# File format:
#   It is a csv file with the following fields:
#   Field 1:  "Plasma Electrode voltage in V"
#   Field 2:  "Repeller Electrode initial voltage in V"
#   Field 3:  "Repeller Electrode final voltage in V"
#   Field 4:  "Repeller Electrode final increment in V"
#   Field 5:  "Solenoid 1 initial total current in A"
#   Field 6:  "Solenoid 1 final total current in A"
#   Field 7: "Solenoid 1 step total current in A"
#   Field 8:  "Solenoid 2 initial total current in A"
#   Field 9:  "Solenoid 2 final total current in A"
#   Field 10: "Solenoid 2 step total current in A"
