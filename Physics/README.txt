This folder contains code, results, SIMION files and Ansys files developed during the physics bachelor thesis. 

Ansys_model_solenoid contains the simulation file used for to simulate the LEBT's solenoids magnetic field.

Beam_LEBT_inlet and Beam_LEBT_outlet contain programs to visualize and analyse data from the SIMION beam simulations.

Magnetic files for SIMION contains code in matlab to interpolate from the B field calculated in ansys to a cubic grid supported in SIMION.

SIMION projects contains 5 SIMION projects in which the beam dynamics are computed for different magnetic fields. They contain the .iob (workbench) .lua (user programs) .ion (initial ion distribution), etc. Solutions of the electric and magnetic fields calculated in SIMION (.PA) have not been uploaded, they are heavy files.
